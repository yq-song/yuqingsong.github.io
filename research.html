    <h3>1) The Art of the Gift: Provenance and the Endowment Effect in Chinese Gift Artworks</h3>
    <p>[Job market paper]</p>
    <i>Journal of Cultural Economics</i> 
    <p>[Winner of the Presidents’ Prize at the 23rd International Conference on Cultural Economics], [Upcoming].</p>
    <p>Art market studies often overlook the consumption function of artworks. Gift artworks, with their primary purpose being relational rather than commercial, reveal how social value converts into economic value. Using a dataset of 9,953 globally auctioned works by Zhang Daqian (1899-1983), one of the most prominent Chinese artists, we identify 3,128 gift artworks (31.4%) and find that on average, gift artworks achieve lower prices than non-gift works. However, provenance and elite dedicatee identities can enhance value. We find no evidence for an endowment effect. By drawing attention to one of the most distinctive phenomena in Chinese art, this study offers fresh insights into how socio-cultural dynamics shape the art trade.</p>

    <h3>2) 1 + 1 > 2? An Exploration into the Market for Collaborative Artworks</h3>
    <p><em>[Under review]</p>
    <p>Collaboration is a common artistic practice. How does collaboration affect the market value of artworks? This study explores the market for collaborative paintings and calligraphy through the lens of Zhang Daqian (1899-1983), a prominent figure in 20th century art, often dubbed as the ‘Picasso of the East.’ Analyzing a collaboration network with 247 nodes and 782 edges, we find that the relationship between collaboration and art prices is moderated by the type of collaboration, the reputation of collaborators, and career stages. We also reveal an inversely U-shaped relationship between a collaborator’s network centrality and the market value of the artwork. This paper offers fresh insights into the role of network dynamics and artistic branding in shaping market outcomes.</p>

    <h3>3) The Valuation of Copies for Chinese Artworks</h3>
    <i>Journal of Cultural Economics</i> 
    <p>Oosterlinck, K., Radermecker, A.-S., & Song, Y. (2025)</p>
    <p>Are copies always inferior to originals in value? In this paper, we first detail the differences existing between copies in the Western and the Eastern worlds and the influence of these differences on their appreciation. In the Western world, copies are often unnamed. By contrast, in China, artists are used to adding seals and inscriptions to declare the authorship of the artworks, even for copies. While the Western obsession with autography explains the lower prices observed for Western copies, Chinese markets also consider the formal aspects of copies in art valuation. Focusing on the eminent Chinese old master Dong Qichang (1555–1636), our empirical analysis demonstrates that the prices of copies may be higher than those of originals when the name of the copying artist is known. The paper sheds light on how buyers value copies in the context of a globalized art market.</p>

    <h3>4) How Does Meaning Affect the Perceived Value of Art? The Case of Chinese Calligraphy</h3>
    <i>Culture Unbound</i>
    <p>Song, Y., & Radermecker, A. S. (2024)</p>
    <p>How does meaning making affect the perceived value of art? In this paper, we focus on a unique form of art, Chinese calligraphy, to explore the effects of literal meaning on the perceived value of art combining both words and aesthetic quality. Based on a 2*4 between-subjects factorial experiment (n = 451), we find evidence that the provision of transcriptions for Chinese calligraphy artworks can have certain impact on the works’ perceived value. Specifically, our findings suggest that transcriptions enhance the appreciation of the value of the literal content and the perceived beauty of certain artwork. This paper contributes to a better understanding of the effect of meaning on the perceived value of Chinese calligraphy artworks, information supply on aesthetic experiences, and the value of Chinese calligraphy as intangible cultural heritage. Recommendations for stakeholders including auction houses are provided.</p>

    <h3>5) Trash or Treasure? Interviews with a Dealer from the Chinese Folk Antiques Market</h3>
    <i>Palgrave Macmillan Series on Cultural Economics and the Creative Economy<i> 
    <p>[Upcoming]</p>
    <p>This chapter explores the phenomenon of “sleepers”—artworks that remain undervalued due to unrecognized characteristics—and argues that they occur more frequently in the antique markets than is commonly acknowledged. Through in-depth interviews with an experienced Chinese antique dealer, we highlight the factors that contribute to the awakening of sleepers (jianlou), such as gut feelings (yanli), regional price differences (diqu cha), and next buyer differences (xiajia cha). We also identify the key elements that underpin long-term success in the antiques trade: expertise, relationships, trust, reputation, and discretion. This research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the broader antiques trade and the art market, revealing how cultural, economic, and social dynamics converge in the realization of hidden value.</p>

    <h3>6) The Network Effect in Art: Success, Collaboration, and Value Over Time</h3>
    <p><em>[Ongoing collaborative project with Dr. Thomas von Davier, University of Oxford]</em></p>
    <p>Collaboration is a common art practice that fosters creativity. Despite its importance, research on how collaboration impacts visual art valuation is limited. Previous studies suggest collaboration is associated with lower average art prices. This project builds a dataset of 267,376 artwork entries from 50 top Chinese artists, spanning Old Masters, Modern Artists, and Contemporary Artists. 5.8% of the artworks are collaborative works. Using this dataset, we visualized collaboration relationships among artists in an interactive network graph with 3,603 nodes and 9,527 edges. This project aims to deepen understanding of collaboration dynamics in art markets.</p>

    <h3>7) Museum Art for Everyone in the World? A Systematic Literature Review on Museum Brand Collaboration</h3>
    <p><em>[Ongoing collaborative project with Jiahui Liao, King’s College London]</em></p>
    <p>Artworks in museums hold significant historical, cultural, and aesthetic value, yet they remain inaccessible to many. Product co-creation between brands and museums has emerged as an innovative strategy to enhance accessibility to museum art. This approach expands market reach, diversifies revenue streams, and responds to declining public funding. Our study investigates evolving transnational partnerships between museums and brands, focusing on collaborations between EU and UK museums and brands in the Chinese market. Applying the PRISMA methodology, we synthesize anglophone and Chinese scholarship between 2018 and 2024. Findings indicate clustering effects within national networks and highlight gaps between Chinese and international discourse, underscoring the need for integrated frameworks bridging global and regional perspectives.</p>
